**Markdown** is an easy-to-use markup language in a plain text format and it became my favorite writing format several years ago because it makes me stay focused on recording thoughts and ideas efficiently.

Up to now Iâ€™ve used dedicated Markdown editors like **MOU** and **Haroopad** as a tool of writing while they all have pros and cons individually. When Atom replaced Sublime Text as my code editor for web development, I tried to use it as a Markdown editor either and the result is amazing. Atom proves itself as a fantastic solution for writing in markdown and it can be customized to whatever you want to match your writing style.

Atom comes with full Markdown support including a robust previewer. It supports GitHub flavored Markdown and includes spell check along with predefined Markdown snippets.

Further more, we can easily extend Atom using the built-in package manager. Atom has a bunch of packages that can be installed to provide additional productivity. Here are some ones I am using:

### language-gfm

**language-gfm** is an Atom built-in package which adds syntax highlighting and snippets to GitHub flavored Markdown files in Atom. I use it instead of **language-markdown** because the latter seems not working well with **markdown-preview-plus**.

### Markdown Preview Plus

**Markdown Preview Plus** is a package that provides a real-time preview of markdown documents with `ctrl-shift-m`. I choose this instead of Atom built-in **Markdown Preview** because it also provide Math (LaTeX) support to the markdown preview with `ctrl-shift-x`.

### markdown-scroll-sync

This package is used to synchronize scrolling between markdown file and its preview.

### Markdown-Writer

**Markdown Writer** adds tons of features to make Atom an even better Markdown editor and works great with static blogging engines such as Octopress as well.

Here are some shortcuts I use often during writing with Markdown-Writer in Atom.

Task | Keystrokes
--|--
`code` | `cmd-'`
**bold** | `cmd-b`
_italic_ | `cmd-i`
~~strike through~~ | `cmd-h`
`'''code block'''` | `shift-cmd-"`
`<kbd>key</kbd>` | `cmd-k`
Unordered List | `shift-cmd-u`
Ordered List | `shift-cmd-O`
Task List | `markdown-writer:toggle-task`
Blockquote | `shift-cmd->`
Insert link | `shift-cmd-k`
Insert image | `shift-cmd-i`
Insert table | `markdown-writer:insert-table`
Toggle headings | `ctrl-alt-1`
