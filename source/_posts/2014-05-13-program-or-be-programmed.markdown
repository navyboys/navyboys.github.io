I took an online Ruby on Rails bootcamp named [TeaLeaf Academy](www.gotealeaf.com) since last month and restart programming again. When we joined the class, we were introduced to see a video on Youtube named [Program or be Programmed](ttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imV3pPIUy1k) and say something we think about it. Here is my viewpoint and self-introduce to myself.

By the way, I really enjoy this online course and the way they leads.

>I have worked for two major Japan-based IT solution providers for over ten years, coding with languages such as Oracle PL/SQL, Visual Basic in previous two years, and then transferred to managerial position as project manager and director of a business division. But I really didn't want to give up technology because I do believe that information technology will change world dramatically than ever before as the video told us, so I took a PHD program researching on data mining algorithms and its application, and fortunately I will get the degree in a few of months.

>In the world we called enterprise computing I usually participated in, our job is to work with dozens of (sometimes hundreds of) outsourced developers/designers/testers to build up systems like ERP/MES/CRM for big firms, and the project will spend a long period, months to years. So, in 2006, when I heard Google acquired YouTube.com at a $1.65B which founded by only two developers, I was completely shocked. I realised that the way we used to build up systems must different thoroughly, not only the developing languages, but also something like TDD/BDD, CI, Agile(Scrum/XP), Lean startup, etc., which I known afterward.

>Back to the video "Program or Programmed", I have no idea if everyone in the future should learn programming to avoid "being programmed", but I do believe guys in enterprise computing field should open eyes to find out what's happening in another world, both technology and way of thinking & working.

>Now, I'm running a consulting firm in Shanghai with several developers, serving small business firms in a non-traditional way, and developing our own products at the same time. I will move to Vancouver this summer and also want to build up a team in North America that can cooperate with guys in China in a REMOTE way, which 37 signals oriented and advocated.
